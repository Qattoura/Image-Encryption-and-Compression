Image Encryption and Compression
Overview
This project focuses on image encryption and compression techniques. It provides two main functionalities:

Image Encryption:
Encrypts images using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) algorithm.
Authorized users can decrypt the image using a password.
Only friends with the correct password and access to the program can view the original image.
Image Compression:
Applies Huffman Coding to reduce storage costs.
Frequent color values are represented with fewer bits.
Less frequent color values use more bits.
Getting Started
Clone this repository.
Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., Python libraries for encryption and compression).
Run the encryption and compression scripts.
Usage
Image Encryption:
Provide the image you want to encrypt.
Set a strong password.
Run the encryption script.
Share the encrypted image and password with authorized users.
Image Compression:
Input the image you want to compress.
Run the compression script.
The compressed image will have reduced storage requirements.
